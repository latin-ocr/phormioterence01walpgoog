meaningless way⁸⁵. Further, teo great prominenee ie
sometimes given to the epieodio characters (προτατικὰ
πρόσωπα). But we may saythat es a rule the poei-

tions are not farietched, the intrigne ie simple and the
whole arrangement true to the reality oi life.

The life depicted was, we must remember, a foreign
one; and we cannot too highly praise the mmm
carefnl study which Terence must heve ⁰1⁶ch
made of his originale, to reproduoe so accurately as he
does the spirit of the Greeks. We should hardly have
expected him to have entered nioely into details oi
oustom and fashion, or abstruse points oi Greek law:
we could have forgiven him, if now and again in slave
life, or marriage ceremonias, or in the law oi divoroe
he bad appealed to popular knowledge and not' to the
prevailing customs of Greece. , But such forbearance
on our part is uncalled sor: the more closely we ex-
amine our author, the more strict shall we find ¹him
to have been in making his drama a reproduotion oi
the ordinary life which Menander and his contempo
raries pertrayed. Now end then there are traces of
departure from the original to satieiy Roman sentiment,
