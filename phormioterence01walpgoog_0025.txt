xx P. TERENTI PHORMIO.

effect Terence is undoubtedly wanting: on the other
han'd he fairly sulfils the definition 01 wit ‘chastened
insolence', as given by Aristotle³⁹z his humour oon·
' sista in contrast 01 character rather than in exuberant
fun such as charactmises the iarcical imitation 01
Mclibre³⁸. There is however plenty 01 brislrness and
life in the Eunuchus (what can be more entertaining
than the parasite's account 01 his method 01 gainiug
a livelihoodl); in the closin sceneos the lermu'o

and nr the third act of the delphos, where Demea’s
sententious remarks and rigbteous maxims are echoed

and parodied by the slave Syrus3 while the dry hu-
mour 01 the scene in tbe Phormio with the foolish
advisere rs 01 00 ordinary quality& Ι1 tragedy and
comedy are 10 be defined by the dcuouement, then
'Terence' rs undoubtedly a comedian3 but his comedies
are mainly 01 the sentimental kin'd: they belong to
what the French call ‘genre serieux' and ‘comedie
larmoyante': there is a want 01 mirth (especially in
the Hecyra and Heuutcnt tinaorupnnos) and the pathos
is at times almost painful: witness particularly the
touching opening 01 the Andria.

We turn next to the handling 01 the plot. Here
rim Terence exhibita considerable skill, except
that his trick 01 making the heroine almost invariably
turn out 10 be an Athenian citizeness becomes a little
worn by frequent use. He is hampered too in point
01 simplicity by the cnstom 01 contaminatio already
alluded 10. The use 01 two or more plays 10 construet
one produces a want 01 unity in the plot: and this is
objectionable, because 11 the principal plot is first
evolved, the rest 01 the play is uninteresting; 11 the
