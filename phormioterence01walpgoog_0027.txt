xxii P. TEREN TI PHORMIO.

long dishevelled heir es a sign of mourning⁴⁰, to the
law of debtors, to gladiatoria] shows, to exile: inthese
instances the allusione are genuinely Roman or may
he best interpreted as such. Occasionally also meta-
phors from war, government, or business⁴¹ are mole
suitable to Reman life. But, ae a rule, the colouring

swaggering soldier without patriotism but leving a
well-filled purse3 the elarm of parents lest their sons

bearing and insinuating addrese: the elever slave, the
receptaole ol his master’s secrete, tendering advice and,
free of his tengue both for reproof and insolence3
these were features in Greek life and these Terence
faithfully reproduces

ln point of sentiment, Terence is somewhet chary

racteristic of Menander is obscured, aa not harmonicus

would be apt to take a sententious turn, Terence suh
stitutes dialogue⁴¹. In the Andria where solitudo is
mentioned, the sentiment added by Menander,

εὖρετικόν εἶναί φασι τὴν ἐρημίαν
οἱ τὰς ὀφρῦς αἴροντες,

is omitted‘³. But so marked a feature could not
disappear altogether, and it was by the use of these
maxims that Terence to some extent cultivated and
humenised his countrymen. Some ol the expressions
are mere colloquial proverbs, others ere fraught with
