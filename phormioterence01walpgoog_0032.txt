THE Tnxr OF TERENOE.

The materiale out of which the text of Terence is
to be reconstructed in its original perfec Μ ΝΜ,
tion are, roughly speaking, ol two kinds: roi ricmrrucr-
riz. (1) the manuscript copies of the text, Μ
(2) the references and qrrotetions of early writers As
however no copy professing to be perfect has reached
us, we are obliged also to give some weight to the con·
jectures cf modern scholare. And indeed many of the
various readings of more recent codd. are themselves
but the conjectures cf scribes, and thet too at a time
when critical sagacity was et its lowest pitch. By far

the most copious and valuable source of evidence is

that derived from the MSS. Here we must draw a
hard end fast line between God. A [the worse.
Bembine] end all the rest. The. extant codd. ere very
numerous, but only nine are thought by Umpfenbach
worthy of special collation.

Of these MSS. A alone is free from the recensicn
of the grammarian Galliopius [7 th cent. s.n.], whose
mmgsmfagpegrded tgl hil othehrs. V contains only freg-
men o n na an nnuc us.

The Berraum codex isso nemed from having be·
longed to Oardinal Pietro Bembo in the cossa
second half of tho xvth century. Itis an unciel, and
consisted once of 14 qahvicacs: the beginning and end
however are wanting. It begins at Andr. 787, but is
much torn up to Andr. 888.
