siveness, the undercurrent of musing melancholy, which
finds expression in terso maxims and reflectione upon
human litem.

This is tho great master whom Terence set himself
Μαι, ,m to reproduce for a Roman audience'2. In
⁹²⁴0st one point at least he has, hy universal
consent, sucoceded: in charm of language he is second
only to his original: hc has just that restraint which
most pleased c Greek: he is mosterol his words, even

skill'ully handled, consonant with the sense, flowing

· easily in narrative, and proving no check to the ap

preciutiou of pathetic passages: so that we may safely
combat the criticism of Quintilian, who seems to think
that Terence transgressed the bounds of Greek se
verity; for h'e says of his writings ‘plus adhuc habitura
