INTRODUOTION. xiii

this anecdota: unless we suppose that 666 play was
not represented till two years after this incident.
Caecilius died in 168 ac, and ths first representation
oi tha Andria is placed in 166 a.(t.¹⁴.

We may ressonahly credit Suetonius’ statement
that Terence died possessed oi a small property cn
the Appian road: he speaks, however, in the prologus
tc the Phormio as though living wers rather a prs-
carious and difficult matter: yet in the main his plays
were successful and his patrans oi sufficient wealth
to keep him irum want. His chief enemy was an
older contemporary poet named Luscius lanuvinus,
tc whom hs alludes in every prologus except that
of the Hecyra. His main charges wera lat, wantos
originality: this has bean already alluded mmmm
tc in the connection with Scipio and resae,
Laelius: 266, contaminatio or the practica of taking
porticus from two or mora plays of other authors and
working them up together. Terence replies by throw·
ing the charge back on Luscius, who had horrowed, 666
over intelligently, from two plays of Menander, the
Phasma and the rhamnos, and by citing the eminent
examples of his predecessors Naeuiae, Plautus 666
Ennius 366, general poverty of styla and diction¹⁸.
Ii the storias told ba true, Terence may have found
his detractura too strong for him: for 6ο ,
escape their persecutione, or, as others 'mmm
suggest, to improve his knowledge of Greek 66666666
and langnage, he took his final and fatal journey to
Graece. He issupposed tc have been drowned as
he was returning home, bringing with him 6666616

1⁴This tells against the later dats for Terencs's birth, as
hs must have eomposed ths Andriast the age cf 16.

¹⁵ But ses Phorm. prol. 6 and note: 16666 esse oratione et
acaptare lsai.
