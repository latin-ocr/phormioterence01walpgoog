INTRODUOTION. xi

Sleves in those times were often of gentler birth and
wider culture then their masters: but judging from the
extreme purity of his lstinity, unobsoured end unde
ffled by any truce of berbsrism, it seems likely thet
Terence was brought over in his early childhood: he
therefore owed to his master his liberal education,
grented doubtless ull the more freely that he gave
token of future grestness. Admitted to the society

end close frieudship of Scipio and Laelius end other ·

petrone oi mark ho had every opportunity for en-
lerging his culture end aehieving diuinatio success.
Detrectors were not wanting to put the most dis·
honourable sense on this attachment of the great5
others, again, tried to rob the dramatist of his well·
earned laurels by insinueting thet the works issued in
Terence’s name were not absolutely his own, but thet
he received material assistance in their composition
from his petrone. The poet himself seems to sllow
thet there was some foundation for this charge, in the
prologus to one of his plays ¹⁰:-

Nam quod isti dicunt malleoli, maian nobilis

huuc adiutare adsidueque una scribere.-

quod illi maledictum uemene esse existumant

eam laudem hic ducit maxumam, quom illts placet

qut nobis uniuersis et populo placent,

quorum opera tn betto tn otio tn nepotis,
tao quisque tempore usust stne superbia.

’ It is impossible to believe thet these words of high

praise can have been applied to Laelius end Scipio, es
et that dete they hardly deserved them: further, if we
adopt the earlier date for Terence’s birth, these petrone
κ were his juniors, and therefore unable or unlikely to
have helped him. Still the evidence is unmistakeable
thet he received some extraneous help.

Six comedies heve come down to us: the Andria,
Eunuchus, Heautontimorumenos, Phemio, neaera.
